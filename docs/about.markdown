Welcome to my blog! After many years of programming and exploring new technologies, I've realized how easy it is to forget interesting things I've learned or built. This blog is my way of giving more structure to those discoveriesâ€”whether it's a cool project, a useful tip, or something fascinating I stumbled upon.

Here you'll find posts about programming, tools, and anything else I find worth sharing. My goal is to document and share insights, both for my own reference and to help others who might find them useful.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something interesting here!
