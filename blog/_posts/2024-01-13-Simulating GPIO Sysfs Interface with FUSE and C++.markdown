Developing embedded systems often involves interacting with General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins to control various aspects of the device. The [GPIO sysfs interface](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/gpio/sysfs.txt) provides a crucial pathway for accessing and manipulating these pins. However, the lack of physical access to hardware can sometimes hinder development progress. This is where simulating the GPIO sysfs interface with [FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace)](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/filesystems/fuse.html) and C++ comes into play, offering a valuable tool for:

1. Accelerating development cycles:Bypass the need for physical hardware during testing and development phases, saving time and resources.
2. Enhancing testing capabilities: Craft comprehensive test scenarios without relying on actual hardware, leading to more robust and reliable embedded software.
3. Easier experimentation and learning: Explore GPIO functionalities freely in a virtual environment, allowing for deeper understanding.

## The motivation

The inspiration for [this project](https://github.com/krjakbrjak/gpio-sysfs-simulator) came from a real-world scenario where access to the physical embedded device was not always possible. Working with GPIO sysfs in such conditions can be cumbersome. Initially considering [LD_PRELOAD](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html) for code injection, the complexities involved led to the exploration of a more elegant solution - FUSE. It allows building custom filesystems in the user space, making it ideal for emulating the GPIO sysfs interface. With FUSE, you gain:
1. A user-friendly environment: Create a virtual representation of your embedded device's GPIO pins, complete with directories and files that mirror the real-world counterparts.
2. Seamless interaction: Read and write to these virtual pins, simulating input and output operations on your physical device.
3. Efficient integration: Leverage the Linux kernel's capabilities for tasks like asynchronous monitoring and pin state changes, ensuring a realistic and responsive experience.
4. Focus on clean code: FUSE handles complex state management, allowing you to concentrate on writing clear and maintainable code for your project.

## Essential Filesystem Hooks

The core of this project lies in implementing key filesystem hooks with [libfuse](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse):

- **getattr**: Returns information about a file or directory, crucial for file system navigation.

- **readdir**: Lists the contents of a directory, enabling users to explore the simulated GPIO pins.
read: Facilitates reading the state of GPIO pins, providing valuable information to clients.

- **write**: Allows users to modify the state of GPIO pins, mimicking real-world interactions.

- **poll**: Notifies the kernel of changes in GPIO pin states, enabling asynchronous monitoring through tools like epoll.

## Automatic Pin Management

The project also automates the management of GPIO pins when writing to `/export` or `/unexport`. This mimics the behavior of the kernel, automatically adding or removing entries based on user input.
Additionally, you can explore advanced features like:

- Error handling: Simulate real-world scenarios where pin access might be restricted or encounter errors, providing a comprehensive testing environment.

- Performance monitoring: Track the execution time of different operations and resource usage to optimize your embedded code.

## Using FUSE Over LD_PRELOAD

While `LD_PRELOAD` is a powerful tool for code injection, it introduces complexities in managing the state of each read operation. `FUSE`, being a complete userspace filesystem, provides a cleaner and more maintainable solution.

## Conclusion

Simulating GPIO sysfs using FUSE and C++ offers a convenient and powerful solution for developers facing limitations in accessing embedded devices. Whether for testing, development, or simply experimenting with GPIO pins, this project provides a flexible and user-friendly alternative to the traditional approach. The combination of libfuse and C++ makes the implementation straightforward, allowing developers to focus on their projects rather than wrestling with hardware constraints.
